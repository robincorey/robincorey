### I'm Robin, a postdoctoral researcher using molecular simulation to understand the dynamics and interactions of biomolecules

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on several coding projects focused on how to run, process, and visualise large datasets
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning better methods for using Python to handle and visualise complex data
- ðŸ¤” I'm especially interested in using different types of machine learning to better process our simulation data
